# Banking_EDA_PowerBI_Project
Exploratory Data Analysis on banking customer data with interactive insights using Jupyter Notebook and Power BI dashboard. 

## 🎯 Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on banking data using Python and derive meaningful patterns and insights through visual storytelling in Power BI. The project also demonstrates SQL integration for structured querying and end-to-end analytical capability.

## 🚀 Workflow Summary
1. **Dataset Acquisition**  
   - A pre-cleaned banking dataset was provided and imported into the Python environment.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
   - Correlation, trends, customer behavior patterns

3. **SQL Integration**  
  - Data loaded into MySQL for structured querying and backup

4. **Dashboard Creation with Power BI**  
   - Power BI connected directly to MySQL
   - KPIs, charts, and DAX-based visualizations built dynamically
   - Dashboard supports filtering and slicing based on customer segments
